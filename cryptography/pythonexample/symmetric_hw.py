""" Symmetric Cryptography Problem 

In this problem you will use modes of AES Symmetric algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the messages. AES supportes 
different modes of operation: ECB, CBC, CTR.

Problems:
1. We will use AES-CBC mode to perform encryption and decryption of the input data.
2. We will use AES-CTR mode to perform encryption and decryption of the input data.

ECB mode of operation example is here:
