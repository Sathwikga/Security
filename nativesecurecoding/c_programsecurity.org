Chapter 2 : The Run Time Environment
------------------------------------

C provides features not found in other programming languages. When you declare variables, for example, you 
- choose a name,
- the class of variable (array, structure, union, etc.), and
- a data type, as in most other languages. 

C is special in that you tell the compiler WHERE to place a variable in the RUN TIME ENVIRONMENT. The compiler doesn't decide, you do. 
This is a bonus, because it gives you more control of your executing program.

The other side of the coin is that the programmer mush have a clear idea of what he or she intends to do.
