Let's say that vulnerable target is behind a Web Application Firewall (WAF), and this WAF has a rule that 
blocks all requests containing /etc/passwd or /bin/ls inside the value of a GET parameter or inside the body 
in a POST request. 
/?parm1=cat+/etc/passwd: it will be blocked by the target WAF and your IP will be banned forever and tagged.
