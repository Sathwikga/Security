Kerberos
========
Introduction
************
- A system of authentication developed at MIT as part of the Athena project.
- It uses encryption technology and a trusted third party, an arbitrator, to perform 
  secure authentication on an open network.
- It uses cryptographic tickets in order to avoid transmitting plain text passwords 
  over the wire. It was based upon the Needham-Schroeder protocol.
  
  
Kerberos Versions
*****************
- Currently used versions are 4 and 5. 
- versions 1 through 3 were internal development versions and never released.
- version 4 has a number of known weaknesses and should no longer to be used.
- RFC1510


The Benefits of Kerberos
************************
- For individuals unfamiliar with the Kerberos protocol, the benefits of deploying it in their 
  network may not be clear.
- However, all admins are familiar with the problems Kerberos was designed to mitigate. Those 
  problems include, password sniffing, password filename/database stealing, and the high level 
  of effort necessary to maintain a large number of account databases.

How Kerberos Works?
*******************
- Authentication protocol which uses a shared secret and a trusted third party arbitrator 
  in order to validate the identity of clients.
- In Kerberos, clients may be users, servers, or pieces of software. 
- The trusted third party arbitrator is a server known as a Key Distribution Center (KDC) which runs 
  the Kerberos daemons.
- The shared secret is the users password transformed into a cryptographic key. In the case of servers 
  or software systems, a random key is generated.
