Kerberos
========

- A system of authentication developed at MIT as part of the Athena project.
- It uses encryption technology and a trusted third party, an arbitrator, to perform 
  secure authentication on an open network.
- It uses cryptographic tickets in order to avoid transmitting plain text passwords 
  over the wire. It was based upon the Needham-Schroeder protocol.
