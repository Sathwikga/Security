Kerberos
========
Introduction
************
- A system of authentication developed at MIT as part of the Athena project.
- It uses encryption technology and a trusted third party, an arbitrator, to perform 
  secure authentication on an open network.
- It uses cryptographic tickets in order to avoid transmitting plain text passwords 
  over the wire. It was based upon the Needham-Schroeder protocol.
  
  
Kerberos Versions
*****************
- Currently used versions are 4 and 5. 
- versions 1 through 3 were internal development versions and never released.
- version 4 has a number of known weaknesses and should no longer to be used.
- RFC1510


The Benefits of Kerberos
************************
- For individuals unfamiliar with the Kerberos protocol, the benefits of deploying it in their 
  network may not be clear.
- However, all admins are familiar with the problems Kerberos was designed to mitigate. Those 
  problems include, password sniffing, password filename/database stealing, and the high level 
  of effort necessary to maintain a large number of account databases.

How Kerberos Works?
*******************
- Authentication protocol which uses a shared secret and a trusted third party arbitrator 
  in order to validate the identity of clients.
- In Kerberos, clients may be users, servers, or pieces of software. 
- The trusted third party arbitrator is a server known as a Key Distribution Center (KDC) which runs 
  the Kerberos daemons.
- The shared secret is the users password transformed into a cryptographic key. In the case of servers 
  or software systems, a random key is generated.
- In Kerberos, users are known as principals. The KDC has a database of principals and their secret keys
  which is uses to perform authentication. 
- In Kerberos knowledge of the secret key is considered sufficient for proof of identity.
- The KDC runs two important Kerberos daemons. These daemons are kadmind and krb5kdc. 
- While GNU/Linux daemon naming conventions suggests that processes which have names starting with "k" are
  Kernel related or Kernel space processes, this is not true in the case of krb5kdc and kadmind. These
  two daemons are run as root in user space.
  
kadmind
*******
- Administrative daemon for the Kerberos server. 
- kadmind is used by a program named kadmin to maintain the database of principles and policy configuration.
- If you choose to disallow any remote logins vis ssh on your Kerberos hardware, kadmin will allow you to 
  remotely administer the Kerberos components of the server.
  
krb5kdc
*******
- Workhorse of the Kerberos server. 
- It is responsible for performing the role of the trusted third party arbitrator in Kerberos authentication.
