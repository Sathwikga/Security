Send a FIN packet.  If the destination host returns a RST then the port is 
closed, if there is no return RST then the port is listening.  The fact that 
this method works on so many hosts is a sad testimonial to the state of the 
networking code in most operating system kernels.

3. Stealth scanning: (works on nearly all systems tested)
  a. sends FIN
  b. if RST is returned, not listening. 
  c. otherwise, port is probably listening.
